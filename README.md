# employee-directory
 Demonstration of modern asynchronous JavaScript via API access.
 
 On load, a set number of employees (configurable via the `employeeCount` variable) is fetched from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/). Displayed results can be filtered, by name, using the search field at the top right. Clicking an employee card pops up a detail view modal, which also allows navigating to previous and next records among those currently displayed on the page.
